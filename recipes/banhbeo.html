    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
    Bánh bèo is a specialty of central Vietnam, especially in Đà Nẵng, Huế, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. It is made from a batter of rice flour and tapioca flour, topped with minced shrimp (Huế style) or a mixture of pork, shrimp, and wood ear mushroom (Da Nang/Quang Nam style) and served in the little bowls. Southern Vietnamese have their own version called bánh bèo miền Nam, where the steamed rice cakes are topped with steamed mung bean in addition to the regular toppings and served on a plate. My family lived in a town called Thủ Đức, south of Saigon so we love the southern bánh bèo version.

  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <h4>Prawn floss (make this the day before)</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>In a food processor add steamed mung bean and salt and pulse until smooth.</li>
    <li>Rehydrate the dried prawns in cold water for 2 hours. Drain and pat dry with paper towel.</li>
    <li>Put the rehydrated prawns in a food processor and blitz to a fine floss.</li>
    <li>Heat a small frying pan over low heat, add the prawns, cook on low heat while stirring continuously for 10 minutes or until dry.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Steamed mung beans (start this the night before)</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Place the mung beans in a large bowl and cover with cold water for 6 hours or overnight.</li>
    <li>Wash and drain the pre-soaked mung bean. Put the mung bean in a steamer and steam for 15 minutes or until mung bean is soft.</li>
    <li>Store in an airtight container in the pantry or fridge for up to 1 week.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Fried pork lard</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Place the pork fat in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Render the fat on all sides for 20 minutes until crispy. Transfer them to a plate lined with paper towel to drain.</li>
  </ol>  
<h4>Dipping sauce</h4>
<ol>
    <li>To make the dipping sauce, combine everything in a bowl and whisk together until combined. Set aside until ready to serve.</li>
</ol>
  <h4>Steamed rice cakes</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Now add the rest of the water, and whisk until you achieve a fine liquid batter. Set aside and let it rest for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>To make the batter, in a large bowl combine rice flour, tapioca flour, and salt. Make a well in the center and whisk in ½ the warm water.</li>
    <li>Brush the dipping bowls with vegetable oil to make it easier to remove them after cooking.</li>
    <li>Working in batches, arrange the bowls in the base of a large bamboo steamer and fill each bowl with 1 tablespoon of batter.</li>
    <li>Set the steamer over a saucepan or simmer water and steam for 5 minutes until the rice cake is cooked. Carefully remove the dipping bowls and repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
    <li>Remove the steamed rice cakes and transfer them to a serving plate. Spoon a little mung bean onto the cakes, top with a few pieces of pork fat and prawn floss. Drizzle the scallion oil and dipping sauce over the cakes and serve immediately.</li>
